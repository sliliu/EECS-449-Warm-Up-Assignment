1. Add a new custom state of your own to the `ChatType` enum. Explain what the state represents and how it can be used in the chatbot.

- SUMMARY (Provide a summary of the conversation so far): This type of chat requires the chatbot to summarize the conversation that has taken place so far, providing a concise overview of the discussion.

2. Add your own custom `chat` node to the graph and define its abilities.
- Tis node ability allows the SummaryChat node to respond to the user's message by providing a summary of the conversation. The respond method uses the respond_with_llm function to generate a response, which is a summary of the conversation.

3. Add your custom state to the routing capabilities of the chatbot. Explain how the chatbot will route the user query to your custom chat model based on the classification.

- The user sends a query to the chatbot.
- The infer walker is triggered, which initializes the Router node and visits it.
- Classifies the user's query using the classify method, which returns a ChatType enum value
- The Router node then routes the query to the corresponding chat node based on the classification. 
- The SummaryChat node is visited, and its respond method is triggered.
- The respond method uses the respond_with_llm function to generate a response, which is a summary of the conversation so far.
- The response is returned to the user.
